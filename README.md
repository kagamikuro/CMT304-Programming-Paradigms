Outline Description of Module:

The purpose of this module is to consider choices in, and aspects of, programming language design, and to illustrate the use of imperative and object-oriented approaches in the context of advanced applications, as well as providing exposure to other programming approaches. This module will introduce the student to different programming paradigms via examples in a variety of languages and giving the student knowledge of basic concepts and techniques associated with these paradigms through practical examples and programming exercises.

On completion of the module a student should be able to:

1.Implement advanced imperative and object-oriented techniques.


2.Evaluate and apply a suitable programming paradigm and language to solve a given problem.


3.Discuss and contrast the issues, features, design and concepts of a range of programming paradigms and languages, such as imperative, functional, declarative, logic, scripting, filter-based programming and pattern matching.


4.Explain the conceptual basis of multi-paradigm languages, formal methods and other programming paradigms.


 

How the module will be delivered:

This module will be delivered through a combination of online readings and videos, face-to-face lectures, supervised lab sessions, example classes and tutorials, as appropriate. 

Skills that will be practised and developed:

Advanced programming in an imperative and object-oriented fashion

Comparison of programming paradigms and selection of appropriate paradigms for a given problem.

Implementation of a number of different paradigms using different programming languages.

How the module will be assessed:

Coursework:  the coursework will allow students to demonstrate their knowledge and practical skills and to apply the principles taught in lectures.

Exam: a written exam (2 h) will test the studentâ€™s knowledge and understanding as elaborated under the learning outcomes.

Students will be provided with reassessment opportunities in line with University regulations.
